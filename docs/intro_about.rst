About Procrustes
================

`Procrustes <https://github.com/QuantumElephant/procrustes>`_ is a free and open source
linear algebra Python library. Procrustes can be used as interpretive geometric tools for
analyzing matrices. The name *Procrustes* originally come from Greek, which means a robber tried to
make his victims to fit his iron bed by stretching them or cut off their legs. The main idea of
Procrustes is to identify some linear transformations, including translation, reflection, rotation
and scaling to match the entries in two matrices.
